# Predict future price Kaggle app

Final project for the "How to win a data science competition" Coursera course.
In this competition you will work with a challenging time-series dataset consisting of daily sales data, kindly provided by one of the largest Russian software firms - 1C Company. 

I have converted this to a flask app.

We are asking you to predict total sales for every product and store in the next month.

All data files can be downloaded from here:https://www.kaggle.com/c/competitive-data-science-predict-future-sales/data
